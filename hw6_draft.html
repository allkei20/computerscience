Problem 3 – “Defining a Function”

Define a function that takes in 3 parameters that are all integers (x,y,z). The function will multiply x by y and then add the result to z. Then return the result.

Problem 4 - “Calling a Function”

Write a short program with 3 random integers that you will pass into the function from Problem 3. Print the result.

Problem 5 - “Dictionaries”

Create a Dictionary that holds the phone numbers for Joe (111-222-3333), Bob (222-333-4444), and Zach (333-444-5555). The names are the keys.  Then delete Bob from the list and add Suzy (444-555-6666).

Problem 6 - “Looping”

Create a list of 10 random numbers. Create a for loop that adds 1 to each value in the list. Also make a separate loop that finds the greatest number in the list.

Problem 7 – “Nested Looping” 

Create a list of 10 random numbers. If the number is even then multiply that number by every other number in the list and add that result to a variable called even. If the number is odd then add it to all the other numbers in the list and put that result in a variable called odd.

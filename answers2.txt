Homework 4 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.430599870611

Problem 3:

There is an empty line above the output.
If you remove the line gc_count = 0 then an error will appear stating 
that gc_count was not defined. 

Problem 4:

AT-content: 0.569400129389

Problem 5:

A-count: 7701287
T-count: 7661547
C-count: 5879128
G-count: 5738773

Problem 6:

Some lines in the data files contain an "N" every now and then so if you were 
to count every letter in those lines instead of strictly a,t,c,and g then you would
arrive at an incorrect conclusion as to how many base pairs there really were

Problem 7:

AT/GC ratio: 1.32234161747

Problem 8:

GC classification: Moderate GC content

Collaboration:

no help needed

Reflection:

I learned about reading in files to a program and subsequently analysing those
files. I wish I had not been as easily intimidated by the idea of reading in 
files as input because it turned out to actually be very easy.

Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.

Collaboration:

no help needed

Reflection:

I learned about reading in files to a program and subsequently analysing those
files. I wish I had not been as easily intimidated by the idea of reading in 
files as input because it turned out to actually be very easy.
